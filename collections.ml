                             Collections

  The COLLECTION module signature is a generic data structure
  generalizing stacks, queues, and priority queues, allowing adding
  and taking elements. This file provides the signature and several
  functors implementing specific collections (stacks, queues,
  etc.).

  (* Empty -- Exception indicates attempt to take from an empty
     collection *)
  exception Empty

  (* collections themselves *)

  val empty : collection 
                
  (* length col -- Returns number of elements in the collection col *)
  val length : collection -> int
                              
  (* is_empty col -- Returns true if and only if the collection col is
     empty *)
  val is_empty : collection -> bool
                                
  (* add elt col -- Returns a collection like col but with an element
     elt added *)
  val add : elt -> collection -> collection
                                  
  (* take col -- Returns a pair of an element from the collection and
     the collection of the remaining elements; raises Empty if the
     collection is empty. Which element is taken is determined by the
     implementation. *)

  Some useful collections

  To think about: For each of these implementations, what is the time
  complexity for adding and taking elements in this kind of
  collection?  *)

  Queues implemented as two stacks
  
  In this implementation, the queue is implemented as a pair of stacks
  (s1, s2) where the elements in the queue from highest to lowest
  priority (first to last to be taken) are given by s1 @ s2R (where
  s2R is the reversal of s2). Elements are added (in stack regime) to
  s2, and taken from s1. When s1 is empty, s2 is reversed onto s1. See
  Section 15.5.2 in Chapter 15 for more information on this
  technique. *)

Reflection on the problem set

After each problem set, we'll ask you to reflect on your experience.
We care about your responses and will use them to help guide us in
creating and improving future assignments.

........................................................................
Please give us an honest (if approximate) estimate of how long (in
minutes) this problem set (in total, not just this file) took you to
complete. (If you worked with a partner, we're asking for how much time
each of you (on average) spent on the problem set, not in total.)

It's worth reflecting on the work you did on this problem set, where
you ran into problems and how you ended up resolving them. What might
you have done in retrospect that would have allowed you to generate as
good a submission in less time? Please provide us your thoughts in the
